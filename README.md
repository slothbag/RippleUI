RippleUI
========

This is a basic PoC Ripple wallet for smartphones based on the cross-platform Cordova framework.

I originally write it back in May 2013 when Ripple was still fairly new and no smartphone UI existed.

I'll be surprised if this still works against the latest ripple network, but perhaps just an update of the ripplelib.js is enough to get it working.
